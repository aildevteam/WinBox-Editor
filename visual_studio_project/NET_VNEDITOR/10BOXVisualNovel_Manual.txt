Novel Directories:
----------------------------------------

BGS - backgrounds
EPS - episodes/chapters (the textual novel itself)
WAVS - sounds

Novel files & formats:
-----------------------------------------

Backgrounds (BGS) - almost any. (try to use a power of 2 image)
Novel plot files (EPS) - .vnp files. (visual novel plot)
Sound (WAVS) - .wav files only.
Characters (CHS) - .jpg files only.


Novel Writing Syntax:
------------------------------------------

NAME1: [0 if narrator]
MOOD1 [Only if not narrator]
SAYING1
NAME2:
MOOD2
SAYING2
...

*Moods: 0-upset, 1-sad, 2-happy, 3-angry, 4-blushing
*Every vnp should start with an empty line.
*If you want to keep it smooth you can use a '0' or speaker and start the next vnp with the speaking

Special Commands:
-----------------------------------------

Use "!" on a line on it's own.
Then use one of the following commands:
	0 - reset commends (effects, bgs, loaded stuff, etc...)
	1 - change background
		This command will be followed by the name (including their format) of the backgrounds to be loaded, each line. (will be layerd accordingly)
	2 - Set music.
		will be followed by the track file you want to set to. (loops! sets only one! writing more than one in one commnad might cause for a crash!)
	3 - Play the sounds.
		will be followed by the sound effects/tracks that you want to play on each line (won't loop)
	4 - Use fade.
		will make a fade effect (1 - on the text, otherwise - on the background. Use one at a time!).
		if 1: (TEXT)
			On the next line should be specified the fade factor. ( a floating point number )
		if 2: (BACKGROUNDS)
			1 - for black, 2 - for white fade.
			On the next line should be specified the fade factor. ( a floating point number )
	5 - A choice/plot twist.
		Will change the plot.
		If the next line is space (" ") - it will just skip to the next line file id.
		 otherwise on each line there will be an option and the line after each option will contain only the number of plot file.
		If the line of the plot file id is -1 - it will just continue usually as if nothing happened.
When finished, use "!" to end the command section.

 * YOU CANNOT START A FILE WITH A "!". IF YOU WANT TO, YOU HAVE TO PUT AN EMPTY LINE AS THE FIRST AND THEN USE "!".

End
